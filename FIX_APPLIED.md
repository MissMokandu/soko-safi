# Backend Connection Fixed âœ…

## What Was Fixed:
1. **Vite Proxy Configuration**: Added proxy to forward `/api` requests to Flask backend at `http://127.0.0.1:5001`
2. **API Service**: Updated to handle Flask's trailing slash redirects automatically

## What You Need To Do:
**RESTART YOUR VITE DEV SERVER** - This is critical!

```bash
# In your client terminal:
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current server
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

## Verification:
After restarting, the frontend should now connect to the backend successfully. You should see:
- No more "Backend server is not responding" errors
- Auth check should complete (even if not logged in)
- Products page should load (even if empty)

## Why This Happened:
The Vite proxy configuration was missing, so the frontend couldn't reach the Flask backend. Vite needs to be restarted to pick up the new proxy configuration.
