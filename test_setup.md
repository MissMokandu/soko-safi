# Testing the Updated Product System

## Changes Made:

1. **Deleted all existing products** from the database (4 products removed)
2. **Updated backend product routes** to handle images properly:
   - Products now include `images` array in responses
   - Product creation accepts `images` array
   - Product deletion removes associated images

3. **Updated frontend components** to display images correctly:
   - ArtisanDashboard: Updated product creation and display
   - HomePage: Updated to show product images from `images` array
   - ExplorePage: Updated to show product images from `images` array  
   - ProductDetailPage: Updated to handle images array properly

4. **Image upload flow**:
   - Artisan uploads image file
   - Image is uploaded to Cloudinary via API
   - Product is created with image URL in `images` array
   - Frontend displays images from the `images` array

## To Test:

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend server**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test as an artisan**:
   - Register/login as an artisan
   - Go to artisan dashboard
   - Add a new product with an image
   - Verify the image uploads and displays correctly

4. **Test as a buyer**:
   - View products on homepage and explore page
   - Verify images display correctly
   - Click on a product to view details

## Key Files Modified:

- `server/app/routes/product_routes.py` - Updated to handle images
- `client/src/Pages/ArtisanDashboard.jsx` - Updated product creation
- `client/src/Pages/HomePage.jsx` - Updated image display
- `client/src/Pages/ExplorePage.jsx` - Updated image display
- `client/src/Pages/ProductDetailPage.jsx` - Updated image handling

The system now properly handles image uploads and displays for artisan products!
